# Verble

I built this game thanks to the tutorial by [Kenny Yip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckjRsPaWHX8&t=2026s&ab_channel=KennyYipCoding), which allows setting only one word as the correct answer.

## Word Database

For the word database, I limited the words to only verbs and downloaded the list from [WordExample](https://www.wordexample.com/list/verbs-with-5-letters).

I also attempted to add a definition feature, which pops up with a one-line definition of the word, generated through ChatGPT.

## Issues to Fix

1. The game still allows input of non-words.
2. If a letter is present but not in the correct position, it highlights it yellowâ€”even for repeated letters.

## Nice-to-Haves

1. Embedded keyboard.
2. Message pop-up after winning/losing.

## Disclosure

I had help from ChatGPT in troubleshooting and learning code I had not worked with before.
